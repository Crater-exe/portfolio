                        I have achieved the rank of Grand Champion 1 in the game rocket league which I play msot often. This is considered very difficult to achieve and is only reached by being in the top 5% of players. When rocket league has a player base of millions this goes to show why it is so difficult to reach even though this is not the very top rank which holds the top 0.1% of players. Through the different game modes I am currently between the top 2-5% of players.
